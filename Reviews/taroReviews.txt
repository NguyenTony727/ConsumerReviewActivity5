I like vegan protein more just due to bloating, it’s very hard to get a vegan protein shake that’s not SUPER gritty. I usually just put up w it and chug but this one is way smoother than all other vegan proteins I have tried. The flavor was so good too! Not super intense or sweet. I tried w water the first time and it was still good. Even better w an almond or oat milk!
